## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript code must pass `npm run lint`
- Components must be properly typed
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)

### Component Structure
```
components/
├── ui/           # Shadcn UI base components
├── features/     # Feature-specific components
├── layouts/      # Layout components
└── shared/       # Shared/reusable components
```

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)

### Testing
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- E2E tests for main features (Playwright)

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No hardcoded secrets** - Always use environment variables
2. **Mobile-first** - All features must work on mobile
3. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
4. **Performance** - Lighthouse score > 90
5. **Type Safety** - No bypassing TypeScript errors

## Collaboration Guidelines
